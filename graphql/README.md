## VolunteerMatch Open Network API V3
Welcome to the Open Network API V3, built with GraphQL. 

### Getting Started
GraphQL is a flexible data query language that allows you to define API call responses to match your use case. New to GraphQL? Check out the [offical docs](http://graphql.org) or[How To GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com) to get started.

To familiarize yourself with the Open Network API, you can start right away making some calls with our GraphiQL plugin (coming soon...)

### Getting an API Key
To request an API key, please [contact us](https://solutions.volunteermatch.org/solutions/api)!

### Making calls
Once you have an API Key, you can either download and run a GraphQL client, or jump right into our example code.

#### Recommended GraphQL clients
* GraphiQL: https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql
* Altair GraphQL client: https://altair.sirmuel.design/

#### Example code
See the following subdirectories, and follow the instructions in their README to get up and running.
* currently we have example code in [Node.js](https://github.com/volunteermatch/vm-contrib/edit/master/graphql/nodejs/)
